# python utilities

Within these walls you'll find various Python-based utilities that I have written to assist with common tasks. This is the start of a library where more will be added over time.

# jsontocsv

<p>The <i>jsontocsv</i> folder includes a Python script that executes as a GUI that will take in a parameter of the JSON element to parse and will then output to the user-specified CSV file. This is a quick and easy way to convert JSON at a click of a button!</p>

# search

<p>The <i>search</i> folder are Python scripts that will accept as arguments the root path to search, the string to search for, the file extension of the files to search, and if a "hit counter" should be included (meaning the number of times the search word was found in the file). The results are saved in a csv file. This is a quick and dirty way to move through a large set of files buried in subdirectories if looking for key words. I typically use it to get a list of the different modules that are imported into either PHP or Python scripts.</p>
