<h2>getpdfhighlights.py</h2>
<div><p>As part of my PhD dissertation work, I review lots of literature that are PDF documents. 
As part of the review I like to highlight text in the PDF files and add a comment to the highlight. Trying to manually go back and pull out the highlights and comments is quite a task. 
So I decided to write a Python script that will navigate through PDF files, pull out the highlights and notes, and build a CSV file for me to then reference.</p>
<p>NOTE: Before use, install PyMUPDF (pip{3} install pymupdf). The app also uses TK for the GUI.</p></div>
